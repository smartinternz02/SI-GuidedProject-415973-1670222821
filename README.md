# Vehicle Speed Measurement on Urban Roadways
Rash driving is the cause of many road accidents all over the world. A total of 4,73,084 traffic accidents were reported during 
the last decade in India. The traffic population has increased considerably in India as there is no means to control or monitor 
the speed of vehicles running on roads. To overcome this problem and decrease the death rate due to accidents, the introduction 
of new and innovative speed enforcement technology is necessary.
         This project aims at designing a device that analyses the real-time video of vehicles passing on highways to estimate 
the speed of the vehicles passed and maintain a log of the speed of vehicles tracked at a particular timestamp.
